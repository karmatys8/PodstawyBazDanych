You are supposed to do those tasks with as many different solutions as possible.

Some "intiguing" solutions with several exists instead of inner join also were presented during class.

I most likely won't do every solution for every task.
My notaion is:
	X.Y - solution number Y to task X
	Xy.Z - solution number Z to y part of task X
